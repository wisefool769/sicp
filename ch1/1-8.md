**Exercise 1.8.**  Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given by the value
![formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{\frac{x}{y^2}&space;&plus;&space;2y}{3}&space;)
Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the square-root procedure.


## Answer
```scheme
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (improve guess x) (/ (+ (/ x (square guess)) (* 2 guess)) 3))
(define (good-enough? guess x) (< (/ (abs (- (improve guess x) guess)) guess) 0.001))
(define (crt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (crt-iter (improve guess x)
                 x)))
```

```
