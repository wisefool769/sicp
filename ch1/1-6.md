**Exercise 1.6.**  Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't see why if needs to be provided as a special form. ``Why can't I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?'' she asks. Alyssa's friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new version of if:

```scheme
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
```

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

```scheme
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
0
```

Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root program:

```scheme
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                     x)))
```

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

## Answer
We can expand as follows
```scheme
(sqrt-iter guess x)
(new-if (good-enough? guess x) guess (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x))
```
`if` is a special form, which will only evaluate the second argument if the predicate is false. `new-if` does not have this property. It will use the normal applicative order, continuously expanding the right-hand side in an infinite recursion.
