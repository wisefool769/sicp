Exercise 1.5.  Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

```scheme
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))
```

Then he evaluates the expression

```scheme
(test 0 (p))
```

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form if is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)

Applicative-order: The interpreter will attempt to the arguments first. It will evaluate (p), but will not be able to simplify the expression since (p) is an infinite loop. 

Normal-order: The interpreter will expand the expression until only primitive operators are left, and then simplify, from left to right.
```scheme
(test 0 (p))
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p)) ; now these are all primitive so evaluate the if statement
(if #t 0 (p)) ; ok so now just give the first entry, no need to evaluate the p
0
```
